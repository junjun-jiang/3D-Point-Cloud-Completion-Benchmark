# 3D-Point-Cloud-Completion-Benchmark
A list of 3D point cloud completion resources. We try to keep it updated every week or two with the latest papers.


## Datasets
#### Synthetic datasets
- PCN dataset
- ShapeNet Benchmark
- Completion3D benchmark dataset

#### Real-world datasets
- KITTI dataset

## Evaluation Metrics
- Chamfer Distance (CD) 
- Fr√©chet Point Cloud Distance (FPD)
- Earth Mover Distance (EMD)
- Accuracy: Accuracy measures the fraction of points in the output that are matched with the ground truth
- Completeness: Similar to accuracy, completeness reports the fraction of points in the ground truth that are within a distance threshold to any point in the output.
- F-score: F-score is calculated as the harmonic average of the accuracy and completeness.
- Fidelity. Fidelity measures how well the inputs are preserved in the outputs.
- Plausibility. Plausibility is evaluated as the classification accuracy in percentage by a pre-trained PointNet model.
